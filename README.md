# Spam Email Classification
<p>This project is focused on classifying emails as spam or ham (not spam) using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and provides a simple Streamlit web app for real-time email classification.<p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw email data for analysis.</p>
<p>Feature Extraction: Converts email text into numerical features using CountVectorizer</p>
<p>Model Training: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether an email is spam or not.</p>
<p> Real-time Classification: Classifies new email messages as spam or not spam through a Streamlit app.</p>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pickle, streamlit</p>
<p>Dataset: A labeled dataset of emails (spam.csv), containing examples of spam and non-spam emails.</p>
